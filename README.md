# Solar-System-RUNGE-KUTTA4
Solar system simulation and analysis (aphelion and perihelion, total potential and angular moment conservation) using Runge-Kutta 4th order method.

Position and velocity coordinates are exactly set with date of 1/1/2019, incase of wanting a further analysis of concrete events.
